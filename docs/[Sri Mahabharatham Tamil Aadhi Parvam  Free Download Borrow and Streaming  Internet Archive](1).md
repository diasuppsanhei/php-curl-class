Karna was born with a divine armor and earrings that made him invincible. However, he was abandoned by his mother Kunti, who feared the social stigma of having a child out of wedlock. He was raised by a charioteer and his wife, who loved him as their own son. Karna grew up to be a brave and generous warrior, who was loyal to his friend Duryodhana, the leader of the Kauravas.
 
Karna faced many challenges and hardships in his life due to his birth and caste. He was denied the opportunity to learn archery from the great teacher Drona, who taught only the royal princes. He was insulted and humiliated by the Pandavas, the cousins and rivals of the Kauravas, who considered him inferior and unworthy. He was cursed by his guru Parashurama, who discovered that he lied about his caste to learn from him. He was rejected by Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas, who chose Arjuna over him in her swayamvara. He was unaware of his true identity as the eldest son of Kunti and the brother of the Pandavas until the eve of the great war of Kurukshetra.
 
Karna fought valiantly for the Kauravas in the war, even though he knew that they were on the wrong side. He was bound by his gratitude and friendship to Duryodhana, who supported him when no one else did. He also honored his promise to Kunti that he would spare the lives of her other sons, except for Arjuna, his arch-enemy. He was killed by Arjuna with the help of Krishna, who tricked him into lowering his guard. He died as a hero, admired and respected by friends and foes alike.
 
Karna's story is a lesson in courage, loyalty, generosity, and sacrifice. It also shows us the consequences of our actions and choices, and how they shape our destiny.

Karna's story is also a story of his friendship with Duryodhana, the eldest of the Kauravas, who opposed the Pandavas in the war. Duryodhana recognized Karna's talent and valor and made him the king of Anga, a province under his rule. He also supported Karna when he was insulted by the Pandavas and their allies for his low birth. Karna remained faithful to Duryodhana till the end, even though he knew that he was fighting against his own brothers and that Duryodhana's cause was unjust.
 
Karna's story is also a story of his generosity and charity, which earned him the title of Daanaveera, or the hero of charity. He never refused anyone who asked him for anything, even if it meant giving away his own life. He gave away his divine armor and earrings to Indra, the king of gods, who disguised himself as a Brahmin and asked for them. He gave away his chariot wheel to a boy who was stuck in the mud, even though he was in the middle of a battle with Arjuna. He gave away his life to Krishna, who asked him to surrender to him and join the Pandavas.
