In this tutorial, we will show you how to use AutoForm Plus R4 for a simple simulation of a stamping process. You will learn how to:
 
- Create a project and import geometry data
- Define material properties and process parameters
- Run the simulation and visualize the results
- Perform post-processing and analysis

Before you start, make sure you have AutoForm Plus R4 installed on your computer and you have a valid license. You can download the software from the official website[^1^] or contact your local distributor for more information. You will also need a sample geometry file that contains the part geometry and the blank outline. You can use the file provided in this tutorial or create your own.
  
## Step 1: Create a project and import geometry data
 
To start a new project in AutoForm Plus R4, open the software and click on File > New Project. A dialog box will appear where you can enter the project name, description, location and units. For this tutorial, we will name our project "Stamping Tutorial" and use millimeters as units.
 
After creating the project, you will see the main window of AutoForm Plus R4 with four tabs: Geometry, Process, Simulation and Results. The Geometry tab is where you can import, edit and manage your geometry data. To import the sample geometry file, click on File > Import > Geometry Data and select the file "Stamping\_Tutorial.geo". This file contains two surfaces: one for the part geometry (named "Part") and one for the blank outline (named "Blank"). You can view them in the 3D viewer by clicking on their names in the Geometry Tree.
  
## Step 2: Define material properties and process parameters
 
The next step is to define the material properties and process parameters for your simulation. To do this, switch to the Process tab by clicking on it. Here you can specify the material type, thickness, anisotropy, hardening model and other properties for your blank. You can also define the die geometry, binder force, drawbead position and friction coefficient for your process.
 
For this tutorial, we will use a mild steel material with a thickness of 1 mm and an isotropic hardening model. To select this material, click on Material > Select Material from Database and choose "Mild Steel" from the list. You can see the material properties in the Material Data window on the right.
 
To define the die geometry, click on Die > Define Die Geometry from Part Surface and select "Part" from the list. This will create a die surface that matches the part geometry with a clearance of 10% of the material thickness. You can adjust this clearance by clicking on Die > Edit Die Geometry Parameters.

To define the binder force, click on Binder > Define Binder Force from Blank Outline and select "Blank" from the list. This will create a binder surface that matches the blank outline with a constant force of 100 kN. You can adjust this force by clicking on Binder > Edit Binder Force Parameters.
 
To define the drawbead position, click on Drawbead > Define Drawbead Position from Blank Outline and select "Blank" from the list. This will create a drawbead line along the blank outline with a default height of 0.5 mm and a default friction factor of 0.15. You can adjust these values by clicking on Drawbead > Edit Drawbead Parameters.
 
To define the friction coefficient, click on Friction > Define Friction Coefficient from Blank Outline and select "Blank" from the list. This will assign a constant friction coefficient of 0.1 to all contact surfaces between the blank and the die. You can adjust this value by clicking on Friction > Edit Friction Coefficient Parameters.
