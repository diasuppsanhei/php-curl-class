## Method 1: Copy the Installation Files to Your Hard Drive
 
One of the simplest ways to fix this error is to copy the entire contents of the CD or the ISO file to a folder on your hard drive. This can help avoid any problems with reading the files from the CD or the virtual drive. To do this, follow these steps:
 
1. Insert the CD into your CD drive or mount the ISO file using a virtual drive software.
2. Open File Explorer and navigate to the CD or the virtual drive.
3. Select all the files and folders on the CD or the virtual drive and copy them.
4. Create a new folder on your hard drive and paste the copied files and folders there.
5. Run the setup.exe file from the new folder and follow the installation instructions.

## Method 2: Replace the Osetup.dll File with a Working One
 
If copying the installation files to your hard drive does not work, you may need to replace the Osetup.dll file with a working one from another source. This can help fix any corruption or damage to the file that may cause the error. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Find another computer that has Office installed or another CD or ISO file of Office that works.
2. Copy the Osetup.dll file from that computer or CD or ISO file to a USB flash drive or another storage device.
3. Insert the USB flash drive or storage device into your computer.
4. Navigate to the folder where you copied or extracted the installation files on your hard drive.
5. Find and rename the Osetup.dll file in that folder to Osetup.old.
6. Paste the Osetup.dll file from the USB flash drive or storage device into that folder.
7. Run the setup.exe file from that folder and follow the installation instructions.

## Method 3: Disable Your Antivirus Software Temporarily
 
Sometimes, your antivirus software may interfere with the installation process and cause the error. This is because some antivirus software may scan and modify the Osetup.dll file in an attempt to protect your computer from malware. This can corrupt or invalidate the digital signature of the file. To prevent this, you can try disabling your antivirus software temporarily while installing Office. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on your antivirus software icon in the system tray and select Disable or Turn Off.
2. Select how long you want to disable your antivirus software (usually until you restart your computer).
3. Run the setup.exe file from your hard drive folder and follow the installation instructions.
4. After installing Office, enable your antivirus software again by right-clicking on its icon and selecting Enable or Turn On.

Note: If you are using Kaspersky antivirus software, you may need to redownload the ISO file after disabling it, as it may have corrupted it silently[^2^].
